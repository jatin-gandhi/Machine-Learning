# Machine-Learning
Real World Applications 

1. Breast Cancer 

    This project creates a machine learning model which prdicts whether the cancer is malignant or benign.
    
    The dataset can be load from the scikit- learn  inbuilt datasets.
    
    Support Vector Machine is used in this project .
    
    The model can be improved by normalizing the dataset and by appropriate values of 'C' and 'gamma'.
    

2. Fashion Class Classification
    
    The projects creates machine learning model which takes an image and classify the class of the image.
    
    There are total 10 classes present in the dataset .
    
    Class 0 - T-Shirt /Top
    Class 1 - Trouser
    Class 2 - Pullover
    Class 3 - Dress
    Class 4 - Coat
    Class 5 - Sandal 
    Class 6 - Shirt
    Class 7 - Sneaker
    Class 8 - Bag 
    Class 9 - Ankle Boot

    Image is represented in pixels(28 *28).
    
    CNN model is used in this project which includes various stages like feature detection / kernels followed by maxpooling and then the     result is flatten and finally passed into the neural network.
    
    The model can be improved by using the higher vaule of kernel.
